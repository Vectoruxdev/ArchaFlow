-- Seed Data for ArchaFlow
-- This file is intentionally empty - the application starts with no test data
-- Users will create their own projects, clients, and other content after signing up

-- System data (roles, permissions) is created automatically via:
-- - supabase-schema.sql (for user roles and permissions structure)
-- - supabase-auth-schema.sql (for authentication and workspace setup)
-- - create_default_workspace() function (creates default roles when a user signs up)

-- No sample projects, tasks, notes, files, or invoices are included
-- This ensures a clean, professional starting point for all new users

SELECT 'Database is ready - no seed data inserted (clean state)' as message;
